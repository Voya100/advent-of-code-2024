This is repository for my solutions for Advent of Code 2024 programming puzzles
(https://adventofcode.com/2024/about).

Puzzle solutions are implemented with TypeScript/Deno (v2). Scripts can be run
with `./main.ts X`, where X is in range [1,25]. If using Windows PowerShell,
need to use `deno main.ts`.

Run tests with `deno test` or `deno test --watch`. Specific day can be tested
with `deno test --filter "day X"`. Linting can be run with `deno lint`.

Templates for day's scripts and test can be generated with `./createDay.ts X`.
